# luFactor
This function takes an input matrix 'A' and performs gauss elimination to get a 'L' 'U' and 'P' matrix out

'U' is the upper triangular matrix which is the result of Gaussing and partial pivoting done on the A matrix

'L' is the lower trianglular matrix which inculdes the values that were used to create the U matrix

'P' is an identity matrix that has been pivoted as to show what lines got switched
