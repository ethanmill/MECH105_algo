# Special Matrix Algorithm

 Special_Matrix takes inputs (`n`, `m`)

  * `n` - length of matrix

  * `m` - height of matrix

 This function create a `n`x`m` matrix where the value of each element in the first row is the number of the column, the value of each element in the first column is the number of the row and every other element has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and the element to the left.
