# Simpson's method function

 Simpson takes in input (`x`, `y`)

  * `x` - vector of x values

  * `y` - vector of y values

 This function uses simpson's composite 1/3 rule and the trapaziod rule to calculate the approximate integral across your range of y values. It will only use the trapazoid rule for the last section if the number of points is odd
